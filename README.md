# FinalATCSim

This Project Aim to improve C++ skills using STD library to create new things. I made Queue, I/O file handler etc by from scratch. This project made for BOP2 courses given by BME.

## How it works?

Given input file example for flights (Each line):
```
FLIGHT_NO  TYPE	  FROM	TO	SPEED	ALTITUDE
38	       COM	  AMS	  BUD	424	  40000
9	         COM	  ARN	  BUD	450	  38000
119	       COM	  LHR	  BUD	530	  35000
```

Based on this input file each line represent a flight, algorithm put this in a landing Queu and give directives for landing.
